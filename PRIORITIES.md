# Detailed Functional Specification: ledare.bkgt.se

**Project Goal:** Develop a WordPress-based website, **ledare.bkgt.se**, primarily aimed at digitizing and simplifying the administrative work for the BKGTS American Football club's staff and board members. The system should complement, not replace, functionalities provided by svenskalag.se.

**Platform:** WordPress (development of custom plugins and themes required).

**Language Requirement (Crucial):**
**All user-facing content, UI elements, generated documents, and data visible to end-users (coaches, team managers, board members) must be in Swedish.**

**Basic Structure:** The website's URL structure and visual navigation should mirror https://svenskalag.se/bkgt to ease user adoption, but the content and feature set must be unique to ledare.bkgt.se.
