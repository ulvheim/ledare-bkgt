# Detailed Functional Specification: ledare.bkgt.se

**Project Goal:** Develop a WordPress-based website, **ledare.bkgt.se**, primarily aimed at digitizing and simplifying the administrative work for the BKGTS American Football club's staff and board members. The system should complement, not replace, functionalities provided by svenskalag.se.

**Platform:** WordPress (development of custom plugins and themes required).

**Language Requirement (Crucial):**
**All user-facing content, UI elements, generated documents, and data visible to end-users (coaches, team managers, board members) must be in Swedish.**

**Basic Structure:** The website's URL structure and visual navigation should mirror https://svenskalag.se/bkgt to ease user adoption, but the content and feature set must be unique to ledare.bkgt.se.

## üö® **CODE REVIEW FINDINGS - CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### **üî¥ CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES (IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED)**

#### **1. Unauthenticated AJAX Access - SEVERE SECURITY RISK**
**Location:** `bkgt-document-management.php` (lines 70-79)
- **Issue:** Non-logged-in users can access DMS content, upload documents, and search documents
- **Risk:** Complete data breach, unauthorized file uploads, system compromise
- **Impact:** Critical - System cannot be deployed in current state
- **Priority:** URGENT - Fix immediately before any production use

#### **2. Missing CSRF Protection**
**Location:** All AJAX handlers across all plugins
- **Issue:** No nonce verification in any AJAX endpoints
- **Risk:** Cross-site request forgery attacks
- **Impact:** High - External sites can perform actions on behalf of users

#### **3. No Access Control Checks**
**Location:** All AJAX handlers and admin functions
- **Issue:** Missing `current_user_can()` capability checks
- **Risk:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized admin access
- **Impact:** High - Users can access functions beyond their permissions

#### **4. Debug Mode Enabled**
**Location:** `wp-config.php`
- **Issue:** `WP_DEBUG = true` exposes sensitive information
- **Risk:** Information disclosure, performance impact
- **Impact:** Medium - Must be disabled for production

### **üü° HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES**

#### **5. Inventory System Non-Functional**
**Location:** `bkgt-inventory.php`
- **Issue:** Uses hardcoded sample data instead of database queries
- **Risk:** System appears functional but doesn't work
- **Impact:** High - Core functionality broken

#### **6. Inconsistent Plugin Metadata**
**Location:** All plugin headers
- **Issue:** Different author names across plugins ("BKGT Development Team" vs "BKGTS American Football")
- **Risk:** Unprofessional appearance, potential licensing issues
- **Impact:** Low - Cosmetic but should be standardized

### **üü¢ CODE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED**

#### **7. Missing Error Handling**
- **Issue:** No try-catch blocks, no user-friendly error messages
- **Risk:** Silent failures, poor user experience
- **Impact:** Medium - Affects usability

- **Risk:** Slow performance under load
- **Impact:** Low - Performance acceptable for current scale

### **üìã REQUIRED SECURITY FIXES**

#### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Remove unauthenticated AJAX hooks:**
   ```php
   // REMOVE these dangerous lines:
   add_action('wp_ajax_nopriv_*', '...');
   ```

2. **Add nonce verification to ALL AJAX handlers:**
   ```php
   if (!wp_verify_nonce($_POST['nonce'], 'your_action_nonce')) {
       wp_die('Security check failed');
   }
   ```

3. **Add capability checks:**
   ```php
   if (!current_user_can('your_capability')) {
       wp_die('Access denied');
   }
   ```

4. **Disable debug mode for production:**
   ```php
   define('WP_DEBUG', false);
   define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', false);
   define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);
   ```

#### **Code Quality Standards:**
5. **Standardize plugin headers** with consistent author information
6. **Implement proper error handling** with try-catch and user feedback
7. **Use prepared statements** for all database queries
8. **Add comprehensive input validation** and sanitization

#### üé® **ADMIN INTERFACE UX IMPROVEMENTS** üöÄ **HIGH PRIORITY**

The current admin interface works but needs significant UX improvements to provide an amazing user experience. Current issues include fragmented navigation, poor labeling, and lack of workflow guidance.

##### **Current Problems:**
- **Fragmented Navigation**: Users must navigate between 4+ separate submenu pages (Players, Events, Statistics, Settings)
- **Poor Labeling**: Generic terms like "Statistics" instead of descriptive labels like "Match Performance" or "Player Stats"
- **No Unified Workflow**: No single-page interface for managing related data (e.g., adding players to events)
- **Basic UI**: Standard WordPress tables without modern design patterns
- **Limited Context**: No guidance for common administrative workflows

##### **Proposed Amazing UX Solution:**

###### **üè† Unified Dashboard Approach**
**Replace fragmented submenus with a single, comprehensive dashboard** featuring tabbed sections for all data management. This eliminates navigation confusion and provides context-aware workflows.

| Feature | Current | Proposed Amazing UX |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **Navigation** | 4 separate submenu pages | Single dashboard with contextual tabs |
| **Data Entry** | Modal forms on separate pages | Inline editing with guided workflows |
| **Information Architecture** | Generic labels | Descriptive, Swedish labels with icons |
| **Workflow Guidance** | None | Step-by-step wizards for common tasks |
| **Data Visualization** | Basic tables | Cards, charts, and status indicators |

###### **üìä Dashboard Sections & Features**

**1. Overview Tab (√ñversikt)**
- **Visual Data Summary**: Large metric cards with trend indicators
- **Quick Actions Bar**: Most common tasks (Add Player, Schedule Match, View Recent Activity)

- **Player Assignment**: Drag players to events for lineup management
- **Results Entry**: Quick score input with automatic statistics calculation
- **Event Management**: Create, edit, and manage matches/training sessions (no calendar view - calendar functionality already exists in svenskalag.se)

**4. Statistics Tab (Statistik & Prestanda)** ‚Üí **MOVED TO FRONTEND "Utv√§rdering" PAGE**
*Note: Statistics visualization and performance dashboards should be implemented on the user-facing "Utv√§rdering" (Evaluation) page, not in the admin interface. This provides coaches and managers with performance insights while keeping admin interface focused on data management.*

**5. Settings Tab (Inst√§llningar)**
- **Scraping Configuration**: Visual status indicators, test buttons
- **Data Management**: Import/export tools, data cleanup options
- **User Preferences**: Dashboard customization, notification settings
